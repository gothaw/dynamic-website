# dynamic-website

Dynamic website design created in PHP using model-view-controller architectural pattern. The aim of the project was to built an MVC website using PHP without any frameworks, ORM tools or templating engines. The whole project has been built from scratch using an HTML template and was a practice exercise to learn OOP PHP, SQL and principles of MVC. 

### Website Structure

The app serves as a website of a gym and fitness centre. It includes:

**Home** - 

**Blog** - 

**About** - 

**Schedule** - 

**Contact** - 

**Dashboard** - 

**Admin Panel** - 

### MVC Pattern

The MVC definition as found on the web (source: [TutorialsTeacher](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/mvc/mvc-architecture)):

**Model:** Model represents shape of the data and business logic. It maintains the data of the application. Model objects retrieve and store model state in a database.

**View:** View is a user interface. View display data using model to the user and also enables them to modify the data.

**Controller:** Controller handles the user request. Typically, user interact with View, which in-turn raises appropriate URL request, this request will be handled by a controller. The controller renders the appropriate view with the model data as a response.
